Read me please :)



For each simulation file and run, important to check:

In function simulation_function:

1. Type of data in gjam  - "CON", "CA"
2. Algorithm to define the alpha, sigma for PY (gjam3 and gjam4):
- For algorithm gjam3 the Neps could be small, sometimes added max(Neps, 20)
- For gjam 4, as alpha posterior doesn't go to small values easy, sometimes in extreme cases the value
 is fixed for 5, so the bound is alpha=5, sigma-0.5. For non extreme case could be relaxed to quantile
3. Check thinning values for trace, weights, alpha  for the output of the function!

For running the models loops
1. Check parallel mclapply/lapply
2. Check truncation Ntrunc for the gjam0, gjam2 - should be min{150,S}
